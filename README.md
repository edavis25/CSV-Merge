### About:
Used to combine multiple .csv files together into one large .csv file. When scraping
data from different tables, this allows you to keep each table in its own .csv file while
still giving the ability to work with all tables together easily by quickly combining them.

- **Merge-Vertical** - stacks each line of each .csv file on top of one another.

- **Merge Horizontal** - brings similarly sized tables together side by side while keeping all data
in the correct position. (All tables must be same size)

### Directions:
Upon launching either of the .jar files, user will be asked to choose a directory containing
.csv files. Each .csv file in the chosen directory will be used. The merged output file will
be placed in the same chosen directory as the .csv files.
